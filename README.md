# ShoppingCart

## Overview

The ShoppingCart application is developed in .NET Framework 4.7.2. The application includes the following functionalities:
- Add a single product to a basket
- Add multiple products to a basket
- See the total cost of my basket
- Apply a discount code and see the price before and after the discount

The solution is accompanied by an xUnit-based unit test

## Future Improvements
Given more time I would
- Put the saleable items behind an API and store them in a database
- Expand the unit tests to higher coverage across more files and place them in their own project
- Extract relevant business logic in viewmodels into singleton services

## Expected Features
Beyond the scope of the task it would make sense to:
- Have items added to the basket be removable.
- Better validation for the quantity input
- Tidy up of UI
- Complete purchase functionality
